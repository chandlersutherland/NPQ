# NPQ

A few of my attempts at processing NPQ measurements obtained using a Walz standard PAM fluorometer. NPQ (Non-photochemical quenching) is a mechanism of excess light quenching used by plants and algae to harmlessly dissipate excess light, and can be measured by chlorophyll fluorescence of dark-adapted algae.
